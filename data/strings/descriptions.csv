els_raad_rack,WEAPON,"Based on the highly successful Hatf strike munition, the Ra'ad (""Thunder"") rocket has been modified to carry a powerful electromagnetic warhead. The Ra'ad's electromagnetic pulse will arc across an enemy ship's shields and wreak havoc on its electrical subsystems.

This externally-mounted rack fires two rockets at a time to improve hit probability. Additional ammunition allows the rack to be reloaded twice during battle.",,,Fire Support
els_raad_pod,WEAPON,"Based on the highly successful Hatf strike munition, the Ra'ad (""Thunder"") rocket has been modified to carry a powerful electromagnetic warhead. The Ra'ad's electromagnetic pulse will arc across an enemy ship's shields and wreak havoc on its electrical subsystems.

The Trident pod launcher fires three Ra'ad rockets in a claw formation. Additional rockets are stored internally, and the pod may be reloaded up to eight times in combat.",,,Fire Support
els_hatf_rack,WEAPON,"The Hatf (""Vengeance"") Standoff-Range Attack Munition is a fast unguided rocket carrying a high-yield explosive charge.

Although it lacks a guidance system, Hatf rockets move much faster than many comparable torpedo systems, such as the Reaper and Hammer, significantly improving hit probability.

This mounting is an external rack storing three Hatf rockets.",,,Strike
els_sirocco,WEAPON,Basically what happens when you toss a handful of ferrous gravel into a big and mean electromagnetic coil.,,,Close Support
els_zdmaser,WEAPON,"A low-energy microwave emitter designed to intercept inbound ordnance. While the beam is ineffective against the shields and armour of larger craft, its high-energy RF discharge can still cause damage to their electrical systems.",,,Point Defense
els_hmaser,WEAPON,"A high-energy hydrogen maser. Though demanding on a ship's reactor, the Heavy Maser proves an effective support weapon, as its withering RF beam easily boils armour and disrupts enemy avionics.",,,Close Support
els_stinger,WEAPON,"The distinctive green tracers fired by this mark of .50cal machine gun are famous throughout the sector for their punishing effect on shields. The Stinger's kinetic energy rounds are almost completely powerless against armour, but they can cause damage to external weapon mounts and systems.",,,Close Support
els_twinstinger,WEAPON,Two Stinger .50cal machine guns in a dual turret. The larger mounting provides a more stable firing platform and improved ammunition handling systems.,,,
els_excimer,WEAPON,"A gigawatt-range excimer laser driven by a built-in capacitor bank. While each burst deals intense damage, the capacitors must be recharged after six shots, making this weapon well suited for a fast-attack role.",,,Assault
els_excimer_2,WEAPON,Excimer Lance Test Article. FOR PLAYTESTING PURPOSES ONLY. REMOVE BEFORE RELEASE.,,,Assault
els_epee,WEAPON,"A long-range support and shield suppression railgun. The Épée fires hypervelocity ferrous slugs boiling from induction heating within the weapon's high-intensity magnetic rails, giving it improved armour penetration over other kinetic weapons. However, the weapon requires a long cool-down period between firing, to dissipate heat and recharge its capacitors.",,,Close Support
els_glaive,WEAPON,"Two Épée mass drivers in a common turret housing. The larger mount improves stability and fire control, providing a modest range increase over the single Épée.

A long-range support and shield suppression railgun. The Épée fires hypervelocity ferrous slugs boiling from induction heating within the weapon's high-intensity magnetic rails, giving it improved armour penetration over other kinetic weapons. However, the weapon requires a long cool-down period between firing, to dissipate heat and recharge its capacitors.",,,Close Support
els_coilac,WEAPON,"A simple, reliable mark of linear induction autocannon, firing inert ferrous slugs in a three-round burst. This weapon system provides measurable, if modest, improvements over conventional close-support cannons, but lacks the demanding power and maintenance requirements of more advanced electromagnetic weapons.",,,Close Support
els_coilac_heavy,WEAPON,"The Châtiment Heavy Coilgun is essentially a scaled-up version of the Arret, firing larger slugs but providing a similar weapon doctrine. Larger accelerator coils give this weapon a much higher muzzle velocity and longer effective range than its smaller cousin, and require proportionally more power to fire.",,,Close Support
els_chevalier,SHIP,The Chevalier-class destroyer is a versatile manouvre combatant that serves equally well as a fast-attack element in larger fleets or as the centrepiece of smaller patrols.,,,
els_adept,SHIP,"This frigate serves as a dedicated sensor platform, carrying high-resolution sensors and C3I equipment that improve the detection and targeting systems of allied vessels. The Adept's multi-mode electronically-scanned array (MESA) RADAR can be tuned in range and resolution to support both long-range strategic early warning and tactical targeting capabilities. While not a primary combat spacecraft, the Adept is equipped to defend itself when engaged.

Commanders should note that the Adept's tactical networking antennas have a maximum range of 5000 SU.",,,
els_mistral,SHIP,"Mistral-class light freighters are a common sight in the Sector, either operating as free traders or as part of larger fleets. Although this compact spaceframe can't compete with larger hulls in terms of cargo capacity, the Mistral is fast, reliable, and mounts enough defensive armament to operate in unstable space.

The Mistral boasts highly modular internal systems and replaceable components, which make these ships easy to repair and maintain. Furthermore, a wide variety of common modifications are available for this spaceframe.",,,
els_awacs,SHIP_SYSTEM,"A system of networked multi-mode electronically scanned array (MESA) RADAR and high-accuracy LADAR rangefinders which, when linked with onboard tactical communcations equipment,  improve the targeting, fire control, and detection capabilities of allied spacecraft.","Improves autofire accuracy, weapon range, and sensor range of friendly ships within 5000 SU. Generates flux while active.",,Support
