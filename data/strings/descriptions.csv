The Adept's multi-mode electronically-scanned array (MESA) RADAR can be tuned in range and resolution to support both long-range strategic early warning and tactical targeting capabilities. While not a primary combat spacecraft, the Adept is equipped to defend itself when engaged.",,,
els_awacs,SHIP_SYSTEM,"A system of networked multi-mode electronically scanned array (MESA) RADAR and high-accuracy LADAR rangefinders which, when linked with onboard tactical communcations equipment,  improve the targeting, fire control, and detection capabilities of allied spacecraft.","Improves autofire accuracy, weapon range, and sensor range of friendly ships within 5000 SU. Generates flux while active.",,Support
