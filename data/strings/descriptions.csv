els_raad_rack,WEAPON,"Based on the highly successful Hatf strike munition, the Ra'ad (""Thunder"") rocket has been modified to carry a powerful electromagnetic warhead. The Ra'ad's electromagnetic pulse will arc across an enemy ship's shields and wreak havoc on its electrical subsystems.

This externally-mounted rack fires two rockets at a time to improve hit probability. Additional ammunition allows the rack to be reloaded twice during battle.",,,Fire Support
els_raad_pod,WEAPON,"Based on the highly successful Hatf strike munition, the Ra'ad (""Thunder"") rocket has been modified to carry a powerful electromagnetic warhead. The Ra'ad's electromagnetic pulse will arc across an enemy ship's shields and wreak havoc on its electrical subsystems.

The Trident pod launcher fires three Ra'ad rockets in a claw formation. Additional rockets are stored internally, and the pod may be reloaded up to eight times in combat.",,,Fire Support
els_hatf_rack,WEAPON,"The Hatf (""Vengeance"") Standoff-Range Attack Munition is a fast unguided rocket carrying a high-yield explosive charge.

Although it lacks a guidance system, Hatf rockets move much faster than many comparable torpedo systems, such as the Reaper and Hammer, significantly improving hit probability.

This mounting is an external rack storing three Hatf rockets.",,,Strike
els_sirocco,WEAPON,Basically what happens when you toss a handful of ferrous gravel into a big and mean electromagnetic coil.,,,Close Support
els_pdlaser,WEAPON,"A phased-array solid state laser designed to intercept inbound ordnance. The beam's focusing optics are optimised for burning through missiles, so its performance suffers against armour and shields.",,,Point Defense
els_hmaser,WEAPON,"A high-energy hydrogen maser. Though demanding on a ship's reactor, the Heavy Maser proves an effective support weapon, as its withering RF beam easily boils armour and disrupts enemy avionics.",,,Close Support
els_excimer,WEAPON,"A gigawatt-range excimer laser driven by a built-in capacitor bank. While each burst deals intense damage, the capacitors must be recharged after six shots, making this weapon well suited for a fast-attack role.",,,Assault
els_chevalier,SHIP,The Chevalier-class destroyer is a versatile manouvre combatant that serves equally well as a fast-attack element in larger fleets or as the centrepiece of smaller patrols.,,,
els_adept,SHIP,"This frigate serves as a dedicated sensor platform, carrying high-resolution sensors and C3I equipment that improve the detection and targeting systems of allied vessels. The Adept's multi-mode electronically-scanned array (MESA) RADAR can be tuned in range and resolution to support both long-range strategic early warning and tactical targeting capabilities. While not a primary combat spacecraft, the Adept is equipped to defend itself when engaged.

Commanders should note that the Adept's tactical networking antennas have a maximum range of 5000 SU.",,,
els_awacs,SHIP_SYSTEM,"A system of networked multi-mode electronically scanned array (MESA) RADAR and high-accuracy LADAR rangefinders which, when linked with onboard tactical communcations equipment,  improve the targeting, fire control, and detection capabilities of allied spacecraft.","Improves autofire accuracy, weapon range, and sensor range of friendly ships within 5000 SU. Generates flux while active.",,Support
